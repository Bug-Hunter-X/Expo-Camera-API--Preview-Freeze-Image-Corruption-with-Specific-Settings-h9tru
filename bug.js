This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with specific camera settings.  The issue manifests as an unexpected behavior where the camera preview freezes, or the captured image is corrupted. This appears to be linked to a combination of settings such as `flashMode`, `autoFocus`, and `whiteBalance`.  The error is not consistently reproducible but often appears with specific device-camera combinations.
